Selenium Overview

Selenium is an open-source tool for automating web browser interactions, widely used for testing web applications.

Key Features:

1. Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
3. Multi-language support (Java, Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript)
4. Parallel test execution
5. Open-source and free
6. Integration with other tools (TestNG, Jenkins, Maven, JUnit)

Components:

1. Selenium WebDriver: Automates web browsers by interacting with browser elements.
2. Selenium IDE: Record-and-playback tool for creating automated test cases.
3. Selenium Grid: Distributed test execution across multiple machines and browsers.
4. Selenium RC (Legacy): Deprecated component replaced by Selenium WebDriver.
